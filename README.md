Collection of Data Engineer Projects

Project  (Analyse TV Data):
- Analyze Super Bowls, halftime shows and viwer rate from 1967 to 2018

Project (IGB: Instagram Business Data):
- This is an ETL algorithm built to access an Instagram Business page and share the information as a CSV file through email. The script utilizes Python libraries such as request, JSON, Pandas, Numpy, and Datetime to pull data from Instagram GET/REST APIs and construct a database to store the ID, access token and username. The information is stored as a token to pull the account profile views, follower counts, impressions and reach.
  
Project (Rise and Returns - Sharpe Ratio) 2: 
- Risk and Return was a program to build my own Sharpe Ratio model. I used this to analyze Facebook stocks and Amazon stocks. Interacting with packages such as matplotlib.pyplot, Pandas, and nummpy. The conclusion that I reached is that the risk of choosing Amazon over FB (as measured by the standard deviation) was only slightly higher so that the higher Sharpe ratio for Amazon ends up higher mainly due to the higher average daily returns for Amazon. 

Project ( Google Play App Market Review) 3:
  This was geared toward running data analysis on the applications that are available in the Google Play Store. To develop a strategy to increase retention and growth among apps deployed into the Marketplace. I utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib.pyplot, to map out visualize differences between categories and user reviews, as well, as performed data clean for the 'apps' databse before integrating the information into the analysis. 

Project (TwitterBot) :
  I created my own TwitterBot Script to upload pictures and statuses. This project was created to assist,
  two college students with their programming homework.
  

Project  ( Email Affirmations):
  Python script built to email the user affirmations. 

Project  ( Music Classification) :
  Classifying music based on genre and popularity

Project (Spotify-24Hr):
This program was created to collect what songs are played over the course of a 24hr day. Utilizing modules and packages such as Pandas, Sqlalchemy, requests, Spotipy, datetime, the script is built to pull recently played songs from accounts and format the data into a database. Creating descriptors for data as columns. Once constructed, the database is uploaded to a host RDS server on AWS to run requests daily. The data is then store in S2 section of AWS. The data is access through interacting with Spotify's API's.
